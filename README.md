# Netflix_Clone
 Netflix clone is a fully responsive web application designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The application has been built using Tailwind CSS, a popular CSS framework that enables rapid and easy styling, and JavaScript, a versatile programming language that allows for dynamic and interactive features.

To populate the application with movie and TV show data, you have integrated the TMDB API (The Movie Database API), which provides a comprehensive database of information about movies and TV shows and images.

With the TMDB API integration, the application can dynamically fetch and display images of movies and TV shows, allowing users to get a visual sense of the titles they are interested in. The combination of Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and the TMDB API allows you to create a fast, responsive, and feature-rich Netflix clone that users can enjoy on any device.
